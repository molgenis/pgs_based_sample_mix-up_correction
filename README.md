# PGS-based sample identification method / Idéfix

Idéfix is a tool that aims to identify sample mix-ups in biobanks using polygenic scores.
Sample mix-ups frequently occur in genetic genomic datasets generated in a research setting ([Westra et al., 2011](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/15/2104)).
Details of this new method are described in the article ([placeholder]()).

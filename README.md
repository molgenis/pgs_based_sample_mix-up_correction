# PGS-based sample mix-up identification method / Idéfix

Idéfix is a tool that aims to identify sample mix-ups in biobanks using polygenic scores.
Sample mix-ups frequently occur in genetic genomic datasets generated in a research setting ([Westra et al., 2011](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/15/2104)). This novel takes advantage of polygenic scores
and actual phenotypes to predict which samples are erroneous. Details of this new method are described in a yet to be published article.

## Getting started

- Either clone this repository using the following git command: 
  `git clone https://github.com/molgenis/pgs_based_sample_mix-up_correction.git`, 
  
  or download the source code directly from github.

- Install the required packages using the code by executing the `src/install-packages.R` R-script.

- Detailed usage of the available scripts is presented in the [wiki](www.github.com/molgenis/systemsgenetics/wiki/PGS-based-mixup-identification)
